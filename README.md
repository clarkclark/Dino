# Dino
Arduino device to augment Jack Butterfield's "Flintstone Car" art car.
The car features a doghouse behind the back window that holds the battery, gas tank, and air compressor.
The doghouse also includes Dino's head at one end and feet and tail at the other.
Goal is to detect a visitor approaching Dino's head and then play a recording of Dino barking 
   and trigger a windshield wiper motor to wag Dino's tail, for five seconds.
Built from an Arduino Nano clone, SR-04 ultrasonic transceiver, relay module, DFPlayerMini
